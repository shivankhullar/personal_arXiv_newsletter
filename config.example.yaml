# arXiv Newsletter Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize it with your preferences

# Authors to follow (use their arXiv author identifiers or names)
authors:
  - "John Smith"
  - "Jane Doe"
  - "Albert Einstein"

# Categories to search in (arXiv category codes)
# See: https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy
categories:
  - "astro-ph.CO"  # Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics
  - "astro-ph.GA"  # Astrophysics of Galaxies
  - "astro-ph.HE"  # High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena
  - "gr-qc"        # General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

# Keywords to search for in titles and abstracts
keywords:
  - "dark matter"
  - "galaxy formation"
  - "gravitational waves"

# How many days back to search for papers (default: 7)
days_back: 7

# Maximum number of papers to include in the newsletter
max_papers: 20

# Minimum similarity score (0-1) for papers to be included
# Higher values = more selective
min_similarity_score: 0.3

# Paper selection mode: 'threshold' or 'fill'
# 'threshold': Stop when papers fall below min_similarity_score (respects quality)
# 'fill': Include papers until max_papers reached (ignores threshold after author matches)
selection_mode: "threshold"

# Output settings
output:
  # Directory to save newsletters

  # Filename pattern (supports {date} placeholder)

  # Use LaTeX for PDF generation (requires pdflatex)
  # Provides proper math typesetting and academic appearance
  # Set to false to use ReportLab (no LaTeX installation required)
  latex_style: false

# Advanced settings
advanced:
  # Use semantic similarity based on paper content
  # Requires computing embeddings (slower but more accurate)
  use_semantic_similarity: true
  
  # Number of reference papers to use for similarity calculation
  # (papers from followed authors)
  reference_papers_limit: 50
  
  # Weight for author match vs. content similarity
  # 1.0 = only author match, 0.0 = only content similarity
  author_weight: 0.6

# Exclusion criteria - papers matching these will be filtered out
exclusions:
  # Maximum number of authors (set to 0 to disable)
  max_authors: 0  # e.g., 1000 to exclude large collaborations
  
  # Minimum number of authors (set to 0 to disable)
  min_authors: 0  # e.g., 2 to exclude single-author papers
  
  # Keywords to exclude (papers with these in title/abstract will be removed)
  exclude_keywords: []
    # - "review"
    # - "proceedings"
    # - "conference"
  
  # Categories to exclude (papers with these categories will be removed)
  # Use prefix matching: "cs." will exclude all computer science categories
  exclude_categories: []
    # - "cs."  # Exclude all computer science papers
    # - "math."  # Exclude all mathematics papers
